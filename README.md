# amazonsearch-api
its just a project I am trying out nothing new.
Hi I am Ramik Mukherjee
I am an aspiring data scientist
currently exploring the field and learning new things like this one its scraping module in python(webscraper)
In this project I tried to search amazon with a product and then collected the data(name and price to be specific)
after collecting you have to validate in json format from jsonlint website.
to use the code u will need a file which will help the code the specific values to look for its included
u will need two modules for this 
# Modules Needed
1. Autoscraper `pip install autoscraper`
2. Flask `pip install Flask`
# How to use
1. Start the Flask development server (i.e. Run the flusk_search.py)
2. Open the index.html in browser
3. Search your desired items 

Thank you
